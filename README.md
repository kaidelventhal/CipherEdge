# CipherEdge

## Overview

CipherEdge is an AI-driven quantitative trading program designed to automate and optimize cryptocurrency trading strategies. Our mission is to achieve consistent profitability by adapting to changing market conditions through a smart, multi-strategy approach. It's built for those who want to leverage advanced algorithms and AI for their trading.

## What CipherEdge Does

CipherEdge focuses on a few key areas to give you an edge in the markets:

### Smarter Strategy Management

Instead of relying on just one trading idea, CipherEdge can manage multiple different strategies at once. It intelligently allocates capital between them and combines their signals to make unified trading decisions. This helps spread risk and capture more opportunities.

### AI-Powered Insights

We use AI to constantly look for new and better ways to trade. This involves:

* **Strategy Discovery:** Our system uses AI to find optimal trading strategy settings across different assets and timeframes.
* **Feature Engineering:** It generates rich data points for machine learning models, including advanced technical indicators, market structure details, and sentiment analysis.
* **Forecasting:** We integrate machine learning models like LSTMs, GRUs, and Transformers for price prediction.

### Robust Backtesting

Before any strategy goes live, it's put through rigorous testing. Our backtesting engine:

* Simulates strategy performance on historical data, accounting for real-world factors like slippage and commissions.
* Supports advanced validation techniques like "Walk-Forward Optimization" to ensure strategies are robust and not just lucky.
* Provides comprehensive performance metrics, including the Deflated Sharpe Ratio and Monte Carlo simulations, to really understand how well a strategy might perform.

### Advanced Risk Management

Protecting your capital is a top priority. CipherEdge includes multiple layers of risk control:

* **Smart Position Sizing:** We use various methods like Fixed Fractional, ATR-Based, and even AI confidence-based sizing to determine how much to trade.
* **Dynamic Stop Management:** Our stop-loss methods are dynamic and adapt to market conditions (e.g., ATR-based, Parabolic SAR, Triple-Barrier methods), rather than fixed points.
* **Portfolio-Level Control:** We manage overall portfolio risk with features like maximum drawdown limits and volatility targeting.

### Live Trading Ready

CipherEdge includes a fully asynchronous, event-driven engine for live trading. Whether you're paper trading to test or trading with real funds, it connects directly to exchange data feeds via WebSockets for fast and reliable operation.

## Technologies Used

CipherEdge is built with modularity in mind, making it easy to extend and maintain. We leverage powerful Python libraries for various tasks:

* **AI & Machine Learning:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, LightGBM, XGBoost.
* **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy.
* **Trading & Exchange Interaction:** CCXT (for connecting to crypto exchanges).
* **Backtesting:** Our own custom engine built upon robust principles.
* **System Orchestration:** Asyncio for high-performance, real-time operations.
